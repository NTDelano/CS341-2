The associated program is intended to create a simple JFrame and display the mean and deviation of all the values in a specific file. 
It uses a button and a JFileChooser to select the file. Then examines for errors, such as an empty file, the file containing letters,
and non existent files. It grabs all the values from the file, puts it into a linked list, and uses two methods to find the mean and deviation.
